# MachineLearning
application of several ML algorithms to predict delivery times for food delivery.

**Introduction:**

The following notebook intends to predict delivery time using several Machine Learning algorithms, from
regressions and trees to deep learning networks.

Several standard tasks are done before from etl, outliers treatment, scaling data and solving for missing data issues.

The following document is organized as follows:
